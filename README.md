# Greedy-Best-First-Search-GBFS-Maze-Solver
This Python script implements the Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) algorithm to solve a maze using the Turtle graphics library. The program visually represents the maze and the search process, allowing users to observe how the algorithm explores paths to find a solution based on heuristic evaluation.
